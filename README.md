I am an analyst and researcher. Business analysis and data analysis are two of my specialties. In addition to being a researcher, I am also a Data Scientist. Currently, I'm pursuing a PhD in Data Science. I have many research publications on Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Text Mining, and Scheduling Algorithms. I maintain several portfolios, including those on GitHub, Kaggle, Google Scholar, Research Gate, CRO, IEEE, etc. With my skills in Python, R, SQL, C, C++, C#, Tableau, PowerBI, Excel, Spreadsheets, and Microsoft Office, I can perform a variety of tasks. As an ICT Business Analyst, I am looking for an opportunity to demonstrate my skills.
